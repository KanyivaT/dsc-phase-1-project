## Project Overview

Microsoft wants to enter the movie industry, and they want to create a movie studio, but unfortunately, they don't know anything about the movie industry. As a data scientist, my work is to explore what kinds of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translate those insights into actionable strategies for Microsoft movie studio. Descriptive Analysis of the various data shows that people have various tastes in movies. It also shows that the foreign gross is much higher than the domestic gross. Microsoft can use this analysis to make an informed decision about creating a movie studio. 

### Business Problem

The business's pain points include: lack of experience or knowledege in the movie industry and competition when it comes to other movie studios. The data analysis questions entailed: What were the top most genres that people prefered, when it comes to investment, the kind of money that was used and if there were any profits, the movie ratings and reviews. These questions are important from a business perspective because it helps one to make an informed decision when entering the movie industry.

## Data Methods
The data that was used were:
Movie Gross
Title Basics
Title Ratings
Reviews

### Methods Used:

Based on the analysis of the movie industry data, the following are some of the recommendations, limitations and steps to do when moving forward.

### Recommendations:
Invest in High Performing genres- People have various preferences when it comes to movies. Based on the data analysis on genres, from the average rating, to the number of votes, to the value counts and the runtime minutes, we can see the top genres. Microsoft should therefore be keen to investing in the top genres.

Profitability- Is it worth getting into the movie industry? We have seen from the analysis that from 2010-2012, the foreign gross shoot up then it went down in 2013-2014, then finally it shoot up from 2015 and 2016, after 2016 the foreign gross then went down again. If we could have more data to understand what happened in 2016 that the foreign gross was so high and later over the years it went down, this would help us to understand what we could do better to make the foreign gross go higher up. I would not recommend domestic box office movies as the gross is very low and it could potentially lead to a loss.

### Limitations:
Data Limitations- If there was more data from other various sources, we could get a lot of information, that would help us make an informed decision.

### Next Steps:
Extensive Market Research and Data Collection- Market research especially from the audience to better understand their needs.
Collaborating with experts from the movie industry- experts from the movie industry would shed more light about the industry and what to expect when starting out.
Continuous Data Analysis- This is not the final analysis, continue to analyze more data and see the challenges and benefits and what best way to improve
